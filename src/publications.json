    "Title": "Brain Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning Methods",
    "Desc": "Applied various machine learning models using Python on the dataset taken from Kaggle to predict Brain Stroke, which is a prominent mode of death worldwide. The data was pre-processed and analysed, oversampled using SMOTE technique, followed by training and testing of the models. The current work predicted the stroke using the different machine learning models namely, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, AdaBoost Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The paper presents the comparison among all machine learning algorithms. Analysis of results revealed that the AdaBoost, XGBoost and Random Forest Classifier made the least value of incorrect predictions and had the greatest accuracy scores 95%, 96% and 97% respectively. Hence, they were the best suited model for stroke prediction and can feasibly be used by physicians to predict stroke in real world.",
